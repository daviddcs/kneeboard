OBJECTIVES
STRIKE 12.2: MET (limited success)

TACTICAL
OWN: Biggest fail was not dumping bags and going gate as soon as I heard the pop-up call. I received the call with good SA and hesitated and waited for leads directive, instead of acted. Resulting in 3x slammers up the bum.

DESIGN
Per Github report TKR TCN issues.

ADMIN
Thanks @Neck for host @Looney for services and @Trollef for lead.
