Summary: Overall nice job! Unfortunetly the dry pass defaults to U.
Note all other IP checkpoints where ticked, and all needed for Q- is a coordinated low-lvl pop
in a non-permissive enviroment. (not MQT-scenario)


- Inital issues with victor frequency during startup.
- Parrot sour on lineup, unsure cause.
- Comm's issues switching UHF to Darkstar. (be more proactive)
- Incorrect brevity MUD called instead of DIRT, also initial call w/o type.
- Good selective Jettison. (twice)
- Failure to fly attack profile resulted in dry run.
- Good MUD call on SA6 in TGT AO.
- Good contact call on aggressors.
- Late with Fox3 in relation to briefed timeline.
- Relaxed a bit to early on Egress, important to keep up SA and Scans until Fenced out.
- Overcorrecting on the tanker.
- Buddyspike calls, always include BE-POSIT and ANGELS + fill-in's.
- Good buddycheck.
- NORDO A/C, establish if the NORDO A/C can still receive transmissions, check/coodinate with C2/ATC to included parrot state of effected A/C. Gently lead NORDO A/C to a straight in finals on clear rwy, continue with go-around after NORDO A/C has touched down.
