Departure Debrief:

Mission event sequence (from your perspective):
T/O, ENROUTE, AAR, PUSH, was uneventful.
Flight committed on x2 Bandits over(N/W) the TGT AO. (Primary mission fail, Jettison)
Diverted singleton to UGKO to meet bedtime VUL.

Learning points (what went well, what went wrong):

OWN:
Sloppy AAR checklist. (good idea to open gate)
Sloppy FENCE. (CMDS STBY)
Chasing the localizer.
Pretty sure I classified one GRP hostile (but did not have the matrix for it) while providing SA to lead.
Visual lookout could be better.


Recovery debrief:

OTHER Anything not included in the above. E.g. technical difficulties, issues with mission design, administrative feedback, hosting etc.:

Thanks @AssafB for host! @Trollef for lead, @Ducky for the SA, @Mosquito and @Photun for the services.
