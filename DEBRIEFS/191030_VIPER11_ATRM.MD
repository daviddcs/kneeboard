OBJECTIVES

SAT TR: Not Met (got retasked)
Support CAS retasking practise: Met Limited Success 

TACTICAL

Overall struggle with system and A/C handling makes everything slow, generally impacting my tactical performance.

I changed/directed formation changes before flight was settled in right obs. after AAR. Bad habit and should be avoided.

Should have mounted/prepped NVG's before they where needed.

DESIGN

UHF STUD 2, was incorrect in first and second Viper on Apron 6. (229 instead of 237 IIRC)

ADMIN

There was one large lag-spike, around 2 hours into the mission.
