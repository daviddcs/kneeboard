ADMIN:
- TKR ARCO 702, was out of Position
- Would refrain from double word bulls posit PORT instead of Exhaust-port (port bad example)
- Incerlik GND charts are slightly messy.
- Use of force qnh is preferred during check-in.

SELF:
- Sloppy Airmanship on T/O
- Sloppy Advisory call joining TKR freq.
- AAR, missed that the TKR did not ack. pre-contact.
