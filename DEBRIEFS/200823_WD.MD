Departure Debrief:

Mission event sequence (from your perspective):

Late join to offload AWACS a bit, got assigned CRYSTAL, east sector.

Learning points (what went well, what went wrong):

Inquisitor 1 and Magics use of white 5 (FL PRI) instead of gray 2, cost me SA on the western side in the start.

Correct brevity is important when trying to sort false datalink contacts. Are you talking about TIMBER or a RADAR contact (with SPADES (neg iff interrogation)), also a fighter should avoid declaring contacts hostile without ID Crits. RED on Timber does not equal hostile.

Recovery debrief:

OTHER Anything not included in the above. E.g. technical difficulties, issues with mission design, administrative feedback, hosting etc.:

Unable to reach weather in-game, TAF rep no help. Unable to support weather from in-game brief due to lack of placed windsocks at Minhad and or F10 markers on MAP.

Preset png's are duplicate between gdoc and github, suggest remove from gdoc.

Suggest remove ATO mission #1 (earlier missions, to avoid confusion)

Avoid using three time zones, all references to Z time is realworld time. Local is gametime aka G time. (adding game zulu is just messing things up, "VUL Gametime: 1900-2000z" is a mixed example), Z or G keep it simple.

Avoid using "long" C/S, such as Inquisitor, for simplicity in comms and on LotATC scope (get's shortened)
