(Strike, AI, GAI, SCAR, CAS, FAC(A), CSAR).

Objective 2: Use correct FENCE as per SOP.

(At no given time must both pilots be heads-down, unless deconflicted and in permissive environment).

Objective 4: Able to give and receive 3-point attack brief.

### Lesson content
This lesson is a special form of self-qualification.
The lesson must be flown with another MQ pilot (MQ or above). MQ pilot will be Flight lead for trainee.
Once all objctives are met, you must self-qualify this lesson.


This flight should be divided in two parts:
Part 1: Low threat.
Focus is to conduct basic A-G tactics in a permissive environment: Recive 3-point attack brief, orbit in a wheel, simple talk-on. This first part is to prepare the trainee to conduct CAS and AR missions with a more dynamic flow.


Part 2: High threat.
The second part focuses on pre-planned attacks in a high threat environment to prepare for Strike, OCA attack and AI missions. The flight need to ingress low level to a IP, continue into the target to conduct coordinated attacks shooter-shooter.
