## SITREP

1. Intelligence indicates that a senior OLA officer is staying at a village very close to RAZOR’s position. This officer is believed to be personally orchestrating the recent rocket attacks.
2. Accordingly, RAZOR has been given new orders as follows:
3. TACP RAZOR will hold position.
4. The remainder of the SOF team will advance later this morning and capture the HVT.
5. CAS priority will be to support RAZOR and establish safe conditions for the SOF approach and assault on the HVT house in the village.
6. Once HVT is grabbed, RAZOR (both the TACP and the assault team) is to be EXFILed by GRIZZLY.
7. ENY ARTY assets in RAZORs ROZ are targets of opportunity and shall be engaged if conditions permit.
8. The latest heavy rockets attack was executed at 0322G.
9. We expect some ENY launchers to be on the move to reposition for additional strikes
10. Until called for by RAZOR, GRIZZLY (escorted by SHARK) is to head for KASHURI where a heavy rocket hit a factory causing extensive damage. GRIZZLY is to assist local emergency crews in rescue efforts by removing heavy debris in two small buildings that collapsed as a result of the blast. (Cranes aren’t yet available;admin: debris simulated by concrete and pipe cargos... ). 
11. GRIZZLY and SHARK are to exercise caution as the site is close to the border.
12. VAZIANI has declared a STATUS RED as a result of inbound rockets. Several PATRIOT missiles were launched; two rockets successfully intercepted and one hit the base; no casualties reported.
